## Troubleshooting
### My Posters Aren't Showing Up
1. Ensure your images are named correctly (e.g., `Poster1.png`, `CustomTips.png`).
2. Check the `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` file for errors related to texture loading.
3. Make sure the posters and tips folders are in the correct location as shown in *[Adding Custom Posters/Creating Custom Posters Mod](https://github.com/se3ya/CustomPosters?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-custom-posterscreating-custom-posters-mod)*.

### The Default Poster (Plane.001) is Still Visible
- This happens if the mod fails to load any custom poster pack. Check the config and make sure you have at least 1 poster pack enabled, check log file for errors and ensure your images are valid.
