        â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€â”€ YourModName/
        â”‚          â””â”€â”€ CustomPosters/
        â”‚                â”œâ”€â”€ posters/
        â”‚                â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Poster1.png, Poster2.png, Poster3.png, Poster4.png, Poster5.png
        â”‚                â””â”€â”€ tips/

## Configuration
The mod automatically generates a configuration file (`CustomPosters.cfg`) in the `BepInEx/config` folder. You can use this file to customize the behavior of the mod

### Configuration Options

**PosterRandomizer**:
- *Enabled (Default)*: Randomly select one pack and use it for all posters.
- *Disabled*: Randomly select a pack for each poster individually.
  
**Enable/Disable Packs**:
- Each pack has an `Enabled` setting in the configuration file. Set it to true or false to enable or disable the pack.

## Troubleshooting
### My Posters Aren't Showing Up
1. Ensure your images are named correctly (e.g., `Poster1.png`, `CustomTips.png`).
2. Check the `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` file for errors related to texture loading.
3. Make sure the posters and tips folders are in the correct location as shown in *[Adding Custom Posters/Creating Custom Posters Mod](https://github.com/se3ya/CustomPosters?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-custom-posterscreating-custom-posters-mod)*.

### The Default Poster (Plane.001) is Still Visible
- This happens if the mod fails to load any custom poster pack. Check the config and make sure you have at least 1 poster pack enabled, check log file for errors and ensure your images are valid.
